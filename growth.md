# This is a sketchpad for ideas about future activities

Elsewhere there are proposals for how to expand the budget; 
here are some of the things we could do with that money

## Subsidizing PhD Student Attendees

- It is expensive for a PhD student to attend the conference
- We could cut the registration fees for students
- We could increase the number of student prizes:
  - Best replication of an existing paper
	- Or best demonstration of nonreplicability!
  - Best unusual compuational tools 
- Am sure we can think of more such
- Volunteer:

## Connecting Attendees with Mentors

- Following up on the session on mentorship in Singapore
- See the slide presentations there for motivation
  - Mentors might be more plentiful if they were paid

## Paying Tutorial Speakers
- I'd propose that we have a minimum of 3 tutorials
- Maybe start in the afternoon of the 7th
- If we made the tutorials 2.5 hours, we could have a shedule like this:

| Time         | Activity |
|:-------------|:---------|
| 09:00-11:30  | Tutorial |
| 11:30-12:30  | Lunch    |
| 12:30-15:00  | Tutorial |
| 15:00-17:30  | Tutorial |

and we could have one or two tutorials on the prior day.

- We could have a category of "marquee" tutorial speakers
  - Jesus FV
  - Ludwig Straub or part of that gang
	- Adrian Auclert is a tentative yes
  - Presenters for toolkits:
	- pytorch
	- tensorflow
    - it would not be hard to identify these
	  - there is a wealth of such tutorials at SciPy etc
	  
## The tutorials could have a more substantial fee than \$25

- PhD students maybe pay half price (or free)
  - with the society making up the difference
