# We Already Do Occasional Conferences

- This year, we will be honoring David Kendrick
- We will also be co-sponsoring a conference in honor of Michele Juillard

# Regional "Workshops" Might Increase Participation

Doubtless the considerable cost of flying halfway around the world 2 out of 3 years puts a damper on the number of people who can participate in the global conference. We could contemplate recruiting people to organize more focused (and fairly small) one- or two-day workshops that would probably be focused more narrowly on a theme each year. The organizational burden would need to be on the recruited organizer (if such can be found).
