# Points in favor of the idea of expanding tutorials

Some other conferences have started to have several days of (optional) 
tutorials on topics related to the interests of the conference attendees.

For example, the IAAE had some very well-attended tutorials, I think maybe for two days (or 1.5) before the opening of the conference.
