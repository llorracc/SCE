# Corporate or other sponsors



Many other conferences are partly funded by contributions from corporations
(e.g., Stata helps fund the [International Association of Applied Economics](https://easyconferences.eu/iaae2024/).

While we need to be careful not to be seen as endorsing the products of such sponsors,
it is not unreasonable to hope that we might be able to get some sponsorship funding
by, say:

- Nvidia
- Google
- High Performace Computing providers
  - might (correctly) imagine attendees influence university purchases
- Cloud providers (AWS, Colab, etc)

A good hunting ground for potential noncorporate sponsors would be
some adjacent conferences that are purely in computing:

- SciPy
- SSC
- PyData
- JuliaCon
